## Summary
- Asked about the thermal sensor, which was missing from the delivery
    - Will likely call Amazon about it
- Showed system diagram
- Looks good, asked if we’re going to do set up any pipelines or deploy it all manually 
    - We don’t know anything about the pipelines, Kasey & Andrew are happy to show us
- Pipelines should let us pull from GitHub into Azure easily
    - CICD Pipeline in DevOps
    - Pipelines -> GitHub
    - Create an ARM template to indicate which services need to be deployed
    - Before that, create a service connection to tell the system where the resources will go
- We should look into Event Grid to pull from IoT Hub to Azure functions - can also handle events when database is updated or any sort of trigger occurs
    - Event Hub may also be helpful, Andrew needs to look into it
- Will look into possibly getting us a monitor so that people can see their number input
    - Will check with Sasteesh
- Planning on becoming more familiar with the hardware this upcoming sprint
- Depending on the end of the semester, the company will determine if we will keep the hardware as a showcase or if it will be returned to the company
- We can email them with questions throughout the week
