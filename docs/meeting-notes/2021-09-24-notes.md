## Summary
- Went over User Personas
    - Said they looked good
- Asked about distribution of the devices as per Dr. Russell’s request
    - We will most likely not keep the devices afterward, but they will confirm with Sasteesh
- Asked about if we were going to have a keypad for the employee ID number
    - Sasteesh confirmed that we will be getting a keypad, so she will look for that
- Will get either a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 - have used 3 in the past
- We need to email them the address for the hardware to be sent to us, as they will be shipped to us
    - Carrie Russell, 821 McMillan Rd, Clemson, SC 29631
- The thermal sensor might require some soldering; we have access to soldering in engineering spaces on campus
- We need to share Azure Devops with Kasey, as she is slowly taking over the leadership position from Andrew
    - She will leave comments on any user stories she sees fit
- Asked about recommended frameworks - best thing to use with Azure is dot net and C sharp, we can also use JavaScript
    - Kasey personally used React for her project, said it was the most simple framework she’s used
    - Unsure of its implementation with Azure but shouldn’t be a big deal
    - Also used Scrimba to learn JavaScript - recommended [Learn JavaScript for free - 7-hour interactive tutorial](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript)
    - React tutorial - [React Tutorial: Learn React JS - Free 4-Hour Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)
- Will get front end experience for this; even just having a Capgemini logo will be nice
- Look at Azure Functions in event hub
- Look at Azure IoT Edge
