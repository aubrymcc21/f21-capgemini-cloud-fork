# Meeting Notes

## Meeting Information

**Project:** Face Mask & Body Temperature Detection Solution - Capgemini Cloud  
**Date/Time:** 2:00pm, September 17th, 2021  

## Attendees
### Capgemini Team
- Kasey
- Andrew
### Clemson Team
- Benjamin
- Aubry

## Summary
- Showing the project roadmap & user stories
- Andrew recommends swapping IoT Hub and the Database
    - Input from hardware is coming from IoT Hub
    - Setup IoT Hub first
    - Use Cosmos database instead of SQL
- Devices will likely come from Walmart or Amazon; will hopefully get finalized by the end of next week
- Need to add Andrew, Kasey, or both to Azure
- Capgemini uses a physical RFID scanner card for employees to get into buildings, but likely we will be keeping it more simple; an employee will enter in an employee ID (keypad). Do a system lookup and make sure they exist as a user; if not, have a user creation process
- Look at GitHub for functional examples very similar to what weâ€™re doing
