## Discussion Items
### Functionality questions
- Don’t need to identify person by their face, just if they have a mask
Have an employee swipe their ID so the information is associated with an employee ID number - not faces
- This software will be used mostly for employees, not customers - people without an ID number will have a temp badge
- CDC guidelines - 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit for fever
- If we detect someone is not wearing a mask, we determine what to do with that info - do we say they can’t come inside, or it could go to an admin software and give an alert. However we choose to implement it
- Don’t want to get hung up on one feature, such as emailing HR or sending an alert. Be willing to think of alternatives to keep moving with the timeline
- We choose which system to use to distribute that information - we choose the hardware/software
- We choose where to send/store that information - focus on Azure IoT hub or Cloud
- Don’t have identifying information attached aside from ID numbers - to adhere to HIPPA guidelines
- Real-time data tracking + daily reporting features - # people who came in with too high of temperature / without a mask. Simple user interface
### Technical questions
- Focus on Azure IoT - can google technologies that are similar to what we’re trying to do
- Waiting to know which cameras/sensors we will use
- Check out Azure to find any AI models for facial recognition/mask detection
- Python would probably be best for this system (maybe C#, as it goes well with Azure)
### Environment questions
- Sensors will be set up near the door
- Sensor must cover a minimum of 4 feet in width
- Person will probably have to walk up to the sensor, but it depends on the sensor we receive
- Sensor only has to cover one person at a time
- We will be provided the hardware
- Python would be the better option for our team
