## Summary
- Received thermal sensor
- Updated system diagram
    - EventGrid is the best option for pulling from IoT Hub & pulling to a function
    - EventHub is for when a bunch of data is coming through - not what we’re dealing with
- Showed simulated device from the IoT Hub
- Will not be getting screen - someone should be able to scan their ID code with a scanner; keypad is only representing that, so the ID will never be input incorrectly
- How do we feel about the devices?
    - We didn’t do much physical with the devices, but we did research how to use them properly
    - Plan to get hands-on with them next week Wednesday/Thursday/Friday
    - Will use diagram Kasey shared with us earlier this week
- Asked how we feel about the project so far - we like it!
- Will send updated system diagram
