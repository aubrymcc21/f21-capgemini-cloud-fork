Project Title: Capgemini Cloud Capstone Project

Date: December 10, 2021

This is an accumulation of the Capgemini Cloud Capstone Project. This project provided an occasion to showcase my technical expertise and leadership skills. As the team leader, I took the lead in creating a thorough system aimed at ensuring adherence to health and safety regulations. The system integrated functions like detecting face masks, scanning temperatures, and transmitting real-time data to a dedicated website. By successfully implementing these capabilities, we established a smooth solution for monitoring and enforcing health protocols.

To run: This project requires a Raspberry Pi hooked up to a temperature monitoring device and a face recognition camera as well as the ADS server being redeployed, so it unfortunately cannot easily be run.
